title: "Custom API (beta)"
---

Deploy a custom API on Nhost. Also called: Lambda, Serverless Functions, Cloud Functions etc.

To deploy the custom API you must:

1. Connect your repository to your Nhost project under Settings -> Git.
2. Have an `api/` directory at the root of your project.
3. Have your project initialized with `nhost init`.

Your API will be automatically deployed for every push to the `master` or the `main` branch of your repository.

## Example code

```js:api/index.js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const { name = 'World' } = req.query;
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${name}!`);
};
```

## Paths

The folder structure inside the `api/` folder will resolve the endpoints.

> If you're deploying your frontend to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) you can add `api` to `.vercelignore` so the API-folder does not conflict with Vercel's deployment.

### Example paths and endpoints

Given this folder and file structure:

```bash
|____api
| |____index.js
| |____users
| | |____index.js
| | |____active.js
| |____my-company.js
```

The following endpoints will be available:

```bash
https://api-str.nhost.app/ - (api/index.js)
https://api-str.nhost.app/users - (api/users/index.js)
https://api-str.nhost.app/users/active - (api/users/active.js)
https://api-str.nhost.app/my-company - (api/my-company.js)
```

## Environment variables

System level environment variables are available:

```bash
NHOST_HASURA_URL - (Hasura URL)
NHOST_HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET - (Hasura admin secret)
NHOST_HBP_URL - (HBP URL for auth and storage)
NHOST_CUSTOM_API_URL - (Custom API URL)
NHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET - (Random secret string. Can be used to authenticate requests from Hasura to the Custom API)
```

You can access each environment variable via `process.env.<name>` ex: `process.env.NHOST_HASURA_URL`.

All your production environment variables added under Settings -> Environment variables are also added to the custom API.

For local development all system environment variables will point to the local development URLs.

## Logs

Logs are not available yet.

## Local development

Use the [Nhost CLI's `nhost dev`](/cli/dev) to start the Custom API locally (together with a full Nhost backend).

## TypeScript support

TypeScript is supported.

```js:api/index.ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { name = 'World' } = req.query;
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${name}!`);
};
```

## Technical details

We use [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) to deploy the Custom API. For now we only allow JavaScript. In the future you will be able to bring your own Dockerfile with any language.
